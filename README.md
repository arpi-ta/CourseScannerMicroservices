# CourseScannerMicroservices
CourseScanner has 3 services on Spring Cloud intercating with each other using Spring Cloud. This project also has a JWT authentication which allows only specific user to login and fetch the details from the Course App.

CourseScanner helps student to get all the courses and can add them into there fav list. I have used mysql here to store the values of the Courses,Fav List and a User.


The backend functionalities are still not over ! 

Keep following !
Happy Coding !
